SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the RedditApplication Class

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The RedditApplication class is used to define the parameters of an
    application which access the Reddit API. The RedditApplication class becomes
    imbedded in the
    RedditOAuthAcessToken
    class after an OAuth Access token is requested. A single Application may be
    used by multiple users or by a single user multiple time. Each user requires
    their own Access Token and a single user can have multiple Access Token. The
    RedditApplication class makes it possible to define an application's
    parameters once and then reuse it multiple times in multiple Access Tokens. A
    RedditApplication class houses the Client ID and Client Secret as defined at
    https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/apps
    . The Name and Description of the RedditApplication do not need to match
    what is registered with Reddit. They are provided along with the GUID
    property as a convenience to identify your applications.
    A RedditApplication is required to request an Authorization Code with
    Request-RedditOAuthAuthorzationCode
    .
You can create RedditApplication objects using the
    New-RedditApplication
    function
    The RedditApplication class is imported from a nested module located at
    PSRAW\Classes\RedditApplication.psm1. This means you can import the class
    either from the PSRAW module or directly from the nested module.

Constructors
    REDDITAPPLICATION()
    The default constructor will always throw an System.NotImplementedException
    exception. It is included because PowerShell v5 classes behave oddly when a
    default constructor is missing. This constructor cannot be used to create an
    instance of the class.

    [RedditApplicaion]::new()

RedditApplication([System.Collections.Hashtable]$InitHash)
    This constructor passes the provided HashTable to the
    _int([System.Collections.Hashtable]$InitHash) method. This constructor
    provides HashTable to RedditApplication conversion.

    [RedditApplicaion]::new([System.Collections.Hashtable]$InitHash)

RedditApplication ([PSObject]$PSObject)
    This constructor converts the provided PSObject to a hashtable and passes it
    to the _int([System.Collections.Hashtable]$InitHash) method. This
    constructor provides PSObject to RedditApplication converstion.

    [RedditApplicaion]::new([PSObject]$PSObject)

RedditApplication([String]$Name,[String]$Description,[uri]$RedirectUri,[String]$UserAgent,[RedditApplicationType]$Type,[guid]$GUID,[string]$ExportPath,[RedditScope[]]$Scope,[System.Management.Automation.PSCredential]$ClientCredential,[System.Management.Automation.PSCredential]$UserCredential)
    This constructor converts the arguments to a HasTable and pass them to the
    _int([System.Collections.Hashtable]$InitHash) method.

    [RedditApplicaion]::new(
        [String]$Name,
        [String]$Description,
        [uri]$RedirectUri,
        [String]$UserAgent,
        [RedditApplicationType]$Type,
        [guid]$GUID,
        [string]$ExportPath,
        [RedditScope[]]$Scope,
        [System.Management.Automation.PSCredential]$ClientCredential,
        [System.Management.Automation.PSCredential]$UserCredential
    )

    Scope: Instance

    USERAGENT
    The UserAgent property contains the text thatwill be sent as the User-Agent
    header to the Reddit API. Redit requires applications accessing their API
    provide a meaningful user agent. The following convetion is what they
    recommend.

    <platform>:<app ID>:<version string> (by /u/<reddit username>)

    Example:

    windows:MyPSRAW-App:v1.2.3 (by /u/markekraus)

    See
    https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API#rules
    for more details.

    Name: UserAgent
    Default value: None
    Access: Public
    Scope: Instance

    TYPE
    The Type property is one of the avialble
    RedditAplicationType
    enum options. This should match the application type registered on Reddit.

    Data Type: RedditApplicationType
    Name: Type
    Default value: None
    Access: Public
    Scope: Instance

    CLIENTID
    The ClientID property is the Client ID as provided by reddit when the

    Name: ClientID
    Default value: None
    Access: Public
    Scope: Instance

    GUID
    A Guid used to help identify the application. This is provided for
    convenience and is not sent to or required by the API.

    Data Type: Guid
    Name: GUID
    Default value: None
    Access: Public
    Scope: Instance

    EXPORTPATH
    This is the path the RedditApplication was last imported from or where you

    . This should be the literal path of the file.

    Data Type: String
    Name: ExportPath
    Default value: None
    Access: Public
    Scope: Instance

    SCRIPTUSER
    The ScriptUser property is the Reddit username used for Script Applications.

    Username is the Application's Client ID and the password is the Client
    Secret as configired in reddit. For Installed applications, the password can
    be anything as it will be ignored.

    Data Type: System.Management.Automation.PSCredential

Methods
    GETCLIENTSECRET()
    The GetClientSecret method is used to retrieve the plaintext Client Secret
    which is stored as the password of the ClientCredential. This is used in
    various functions to retrieve the Client Secret in order to authenticate the
    application with OAuth.

    Definition: string  GetUserPassword()

    _INIT([SYSTEM.COLLECTIONS.HASHTABLE]$INITHASH)
    The _init hidden method is used by the constructors to initialize the class.
    This way class initialization code can be maintained in a single methods
    instead of each constructor. It performs serveral checks to ensure that
    required properties are provided and will throw System.ArgumentException
    exceptions if the requirements are not met.

    Data Type: Void
    Name: _init
    Access: Hidden
    Scope: Instance
