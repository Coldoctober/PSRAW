SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the RedditOAuthGrantType Enum

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The `RedditOAuthGrantType` enumerator contains the available grant types
    available for OAuth Access Tokens requests on Reddit. this is visible on
    `RedditOAuthToken` objects as the `GrantType` property. It is used by
    various functions in this module to determine the actions and endpoints
    required to request Access Tokens.
    The `RedditOAuthGrantType` Enumerator is imported automatically when you
    import the PSRAW module.

FIELDS
Authorization_Code
    This Grant method requires that the Reddit user authorize the application
    and return an OAuth Authorization code. The application mst the used the
    Authorization Code, the Client, ID, and client Secret to request an Access
    Token. For more information see the `Code` parameter description of
    `Request-RedditOAuthToken` or the Reddit OAuth documentation at
    https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/OAuth2#token-retrieval-code-flow

Client_Credentials
    This grant method uses the Client ID and Client Secret to request an
    anonymous Access Token. This method will not act under a user context but
    will allow "logged out" access to the OAuth API endpoints for `Script` and
    `WebApp` applications. For more information see the `Client` parameter
    description of `Request-RedditOAuthToken` or the Reddit OAuth documentation
    at  https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/OAuth2#application-only-oauth

Implicit
    This grant flow allows temporary "logged in" access to the Reddit API on
    behalf of the user who authorizes the application. This is only available
    for `Installed` applications. When the Access Token expires, a new
    `Implicit` grant flow must be initiated and the applications will need to be
    re-authorized by the user. For more information see the `Implicit` parameter
    description of `Request-RedditOAuthToken` or the Reddit OAuth documentation
    at
    https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/OAuth2#authorization-implicit-grant-flow

Installed_Client
    This grant flow allows anonymous access to the Reddit API for `Installed`
    applications. This method will not act under a user context but will allow
    "logged out" access to the OAuth API endpoints.  For more information see
    the `Installed` parameter description of `Request-RedditOAuthToken` or the
    Reddit OAuth documentation at
    https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/OAuth2#application-only-oauth

Password
    This grant flow allows for the developer of `Script` applications to access
    the Reddit API as themselves. This uses the Username, Password, Client ID,
    and Client Secret to request an OAuth Access Token.  For more information
    see the `Script` parameter description of `Request-RedditOAuthToken` or the
    Reddit OAuth documentation at
    https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/OAuth2#application-only-oauth

Refresh_Token
    This grant flow is used to request new OAuth Access Tokens for `Permanent`
    requests. `Code` and `Password` grant flows can request `Permanent` Access
    Tokens which will issue a Refresh Token with the Access Token. When an
    Access Token expires, the application can use the Refresh Token to request a
    new Access Token without requiring the user reauthorizing the application.
    The Refresh Token is valid until the user or applications revokes the
    authorization. For more information see
    https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/OAuth2#refreshing-the-token
