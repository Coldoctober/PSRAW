SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the RedditScope Class

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The ReditScope Class is used to define OAuth Scopes for reddit's API. All
    OAuth bearer tokens are limited in what functions they may perform. Scopes
    for an application define what the application can and cannot do on the API.
    When creating a new RedditApplication class, one or more RedditScope's are
    required ro be set on the Scope property. When a request is made for an
    OAuth Authorization Code, the scopes will be provided and the resulting
    Access Token will only be valid for those scopes.
    ReditScope's can be created manually or you can retrieve all valid scopes
    with
    Get-RedditOAuthScope
    .
    The RedditScope class is imported from a nested module located at
    PSRAW\Classes\RedditScope.psm1. This means you can import the class either
    from the PSRAW module or directly from the nested module.

Constructors
    REDDITSCOPE()
    Initializes an empty RedditScope.

    [RedditScope]::New()

    REDDITSCOPE([STRING]$SCOPE)
    Initializes a RedditScope where all members match the provided string.

    [RedditScope]::New([String]$Scope)

    REDDITSCOPE([STRING]$SCOPE, [STRING]$ID, [STRING]$NAME, [STRING]$DESCRIPTION)
    Initializes a RedditScope with all the properties.

    [RedditScope]::New([String]$Scope, [String]$Id, [String]$Name, [String]$Description)

Properties
    SCOPE
    Redit's API reuturns a JSON hobject that contains an array of hashes. The
    Scope property preprsents the name of the scope hash. In most cases this
    matches the Id.

    Data Type: String
    Name: Scope
    Default value: None
    Access: Public
    Scope: Instance

    ID
    This is the ID of the Scope that is used in OAuth Authorization Code
    requests.

    Data Type: String
    Name: Id
    Default value: None
    Access: Public
    Scope: Instance

    NAME
    A short descriptive name of the scope

    Data Type: String
    Name: Name
    Default value: None
    Access: Public
    Scope: Instance

    DESCRIPTION
    Longer description of the scope.

    Data Type: String
    Name: Name
    Default value: None
    Access: Public
    Scope: Instance

    APIENDPOINTURI
    The ApiEndpointUri static member is included on all API generated objects.
    It is a template string for the API End Point to access objects of that
    class. To get a formatted string to make API calls, use the
    GetApiEndpointUri() static method(s).

    Data Type: String
    Name: ApiEndpointUri
    Value: 'https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/scopes'
    Access: Public
    Scope: Static

Methods
    _INIT([STRING]$SCOPE, [STRING]$ID, [STRING]$NAME, [STRING]$DESCRIPTION)
    The _init hidden method is used by the constructors to initialize the class.
    This way class initialization code can be maintained in a single methods
    instead of each constructor.

    Data Type: Void
    Name: _init
    Access: Hidden
    Scope: Instance
    Definition: hidden void _init(string Scope, string Id, string Name, string Description)

    GETAPIENDPOINTURI()
    The GetApiEndpointUri static method is included on all API generated
    objects. It returns a formatted string for the API End Point that is used to
    query objects of this class.

    Data Type: String
    Name: GetApiEndpointUri
    Access: Public
    Scope: Static
    Definition: static string GetApiEndpointUri()

EXAMPLES
Using the RedditScope.psm1
    Using module '.\PSRAW\Classes\RedditScope.psm1'
    $Scope = [RedditScope]@{
        Scope = 'creddits'
        Id = 'creddits'
        Name = 'Spend reddit gold creddits'
        Description = 'Spend my reddit gold creddits on giving gold to other users.'
    }

Using PSRAW
    Using module PSRAW
    $Scope = [PSRAW.RedditScope]@{
        Scope = 'creddits'
        Id = 'creddits'
        Name = 'Spend reddit gold creddits'
        Description = 'Spend my reddit gold creddits on giving gold to other users.'
    }

Simple String Scope
    Using module PSRAW
    $ReadScope = [PSRAW.RedditScope]'read'
